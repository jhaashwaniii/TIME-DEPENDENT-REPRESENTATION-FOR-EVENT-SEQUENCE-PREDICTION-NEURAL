# TIME-DEPENDENT-REPRESENTATION-FOR-NEURAL-EVENT-SEQUENCE-PREDICTION

Our task is to predict next asynchronous event and time by
modeling time information in the event. For example next disease
patient is most likely to get and at what time.

## Datasets
we are using Two datasets

• MIMIC II : In this, task is to predict the next disease of
particular patient.

• Stack Overflow : In this, task is to predict the ext badge of
the user.
